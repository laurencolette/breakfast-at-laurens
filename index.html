						<p class="text"><span class="title">LET'S MAKE BREAKFAST EXCITING AGAIN!</span><br>
						  This site is for anyone that dreads breakfast and wants to find joy in it again. Maybe youâ€™re a breakfast-lover looking to find new recipes. Maybe you're somoene who stopped eating the meal and wants to start it up again. Either way, you've come to the right place where I've compiled a variety of my favorite nutritious and delicious breakfast foods. (BONUS: they're pretty and they don't even have to be eaten for breakfast.)  </p>
							<p> First things first; my favorite breakfasts to make are oats and smoothies. This is what the majority of the recipes featured on this site will be.   </p>
							<p> Second of all, check out the mantras I live by when eating, down below!   </p>

				<p class="text"><span class="title">HEALTHY FOOD CAN BE SWEET <i class="fas fa-cookie"></i> </span><br>
					Many of you might think healthy food as bland, but when using plenty of fruit and natural sweet flavors, such as maple syrup or honey, nutritious food can be delictably sweet.
			</div>
			<div class="words3">
				<p class="text"><span class="title">WHOLE FOODS ARE ESSENTIAL <i class="fas fa-seedling"></i> </span><br>
					The key to having a healthy diet isn't "low calories" or "high protein"; it's having a variety of nutritious whole foods (foods that are minimally processed such as oats, fruit, and more).
			</div>
			<div class="words4">
				<p class="text"><span class="title">LET FOOD BE YOUR CANVAS <i class="fas fa-rainbow"></i> </span><br>
					Food can be art. It doesn't have to be boring. Using many different fruits, toppings, spices, and more, often allows you to create an aesthetically-pleasing display of food if you choose to do so.
			</div>
			<div class="words5">
				<p class="text"><span class="title">MAKE SURE TO ENJOY YOUR FOOD <i class="fas fa-smile"></i></span><br>
					If you don't like or enjoy the food that you're eating, you're not going to want to eat it again.
