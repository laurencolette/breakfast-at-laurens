					<p class="text"><span class="title">PICKING THE OATS</span><br>
						<p> There are a variety of different oats out there, but two of the most basic types that youâ€™re likely to run into at the store are rolled oats and quick oats. </p>
				</div>
					<div id="sh1">
    				<p class="subhead"><span>ROLLED OATS:</span><br>
							Pre-cooked oats that have been dried and rolled. Rolled oats take a longer than quick oats to cook, but will retain more texture. Has the same nutritional value as qucik oats, though.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="sh2">
						<p class="subhead"><span>QUICK OATS:</span><br>
							Oats that have also been pre-cooked, dried and rolled. However these have been rolled into smaller pieces; meaning they cook faster, retain less texture, and often have a mushier texture.</p>
					</div>
			<div id="header2">
				<p class="text"><span class="title">COOKING THE OATS</span><br>
					<p> The main ways to cook oats include: </p>
			</div>
				<div id="sh3">
					<p class="subhead"><span>MICROWAVE:</span><br>
						<p> This is the fastest way to cook oats. This method is best if you want a mushier-textured, porridge-like consistency of oats. Add any ratio of water and/or milk to cook oats. (Milk will give your oats a creamier texture.)</p>
				</div>
				<div id="sh4">
						<p class="subhead"><span>STOVETOP:</span><br>
							<p> This method is going to take longer to cook. However, the texture is going to be a lot chewier. It's easier to distinguish the individaul pieces of oat when eaten this way.</p>

				<p class="text"><span class="title">TOPPING THE OATS</span><br>
			</div>
				<div id="sh5">
					<p class="subhead"><span>FLAVORS:</span><br>
					<p> Plain oats are bland. Natural sweetners, such as vanilla, maple syrup, and honey do wonders to sweeten up oatmeal. Additionally, just a pinch of salt balances out the sweetness added and brings out the flavor of the oats once they're cooked. </p>
				</div>
				<div id=sh6>
					<p class="subhead"><span>FRUIT:</span><br>
						<p> Fruit is rich in other essential nutrients, like Vitamin C, adds more sweetness and nutrients to your oats. These fruits can be either fresh or frozen. In fact, adding the fruit before you cook the oats, can even change the flavor (and color) of the oats themselves. ome of my favorites include banana, blueberries, and strawberries. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="sh7">
					<p class="subhead"><span>MORE:</span><br>
						<p> You can never have too many toppings in your oats. Different nut butters like peanut butter can be added to oats. Additionally, cocoa powder or a little bit of chocolate chips add a rich chocolatey flavor to oats. One of my favorite things to throw into oatmeal is actually vanilla protein powder, as it adds a strong vanilla flavor toward your oats. If you want to go above and beyond, feel free to add nuts and seeds such as chia or hemp seeds to dress your oats and add on more nutritional benefits.  </p>
